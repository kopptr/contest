[Netrunner](https://nullsignal.games/about/netrunner/) is an asymmetric collectible card game, where one player plays the role of Corporation, and the other plays the role of Runner. The Corporation wins if he can score 7 points' worth of Agendas or kill the runner. The Runner wins if he can steal 7 points' worth of the Corp's Agendas or cause the Corp to run out of cards.

## Asymmetry
Since playing as Corp is effectively an entirely different game than playing as Runner, this event is treated as two separate events. Therefore, twice as many points are available for Netrunner as for other events. Where possible, games should be played in an alternating manner, where a player plays as Corp, then Runner, then Corp, and so on.

## Rules
- Games will be played on [Jinteki.net](https://www.jinteki.net/) on a discord call.
- Decks:
	- Must be valid for the [Startup](https://nullsignal.games/players/supported-formats/#startup) format as validated on [netrunnerdb](https://netrunnerdb.com/).
	- Must use the latest banlist and other constraints as of 2025-06-01.
	- Using online deckbuilding resources, like [netrunnerdb](https://netrunnerdb.com/), is perfectly legal.
	- Decklists must be submitted to the commissioner before play begins, but contestants need not share their decklists with their opponents.
	- Contestants may submit up to two Corp decklists and two Runner decklists.
- Structure:
	- Best of three games with one player as Runner and the other as Corp. Independently, best of three with the roles reversed.
	- Contestants may switch between their presubmitted decklists between games.

## Perks
- X: Mulligan your hand an additional time. Can be used only once per game.
- X: To be use after a deck is chosen but before play begins. Force your opponent to use his other deck, if he has one.
- X: To be used between games. Add up to five cards to your deck. Subtract up to five cards from your deck. The result must be a legal deck.
- X: Spend 1 click to gain 3 credits. Can only be used once per game.
- X+1: Prevent your opponent from doing any of the above.

## Scoring
- Contestants get 1 point per win. If a contestant wins the first two games in the same role, he is awarded an additional point (3 total) and the third game is not played.
- Therefore, up to 6 points are available for Netrunner, and a contestant can win them all by going undefeated for four games, two as Runner and two as Corp.
